### How to get your Discord token ###
- - - -
    * In Discord, do `Ctrl + Shift + i` on Windows or `Cmd + Option + i` on Mac, respectively.
    * Go into the Application tab, and navigate to Local Store > discord.com
    * Click on Toggle Device Option (it will look like a tablet and phone).
    * Enter 'token' into the search bar, and copy the value in the quotes. It should look like a long string of random characters.
    * Don't give this out to anyone! You'll need this token soon.

Note: If you change your password or enable/disable two-factor authentication, your token will change. If this happens, and you've already set up the bot, you'll need to change the token by editing the config.json file.
